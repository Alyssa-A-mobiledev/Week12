Step 1 — Add the toggle button to the navbar
- Add a <button id="dark-mode-toggle"> with a ☀/🌙 icon to the <header> in all 4 HTML files
No JS or CSS yet — just the HTML element
Test: button appears in the navbar on every page

Step 2 — Define dark mode colors in styles.css
- Add a body.dark-mode { ... } block that overrides your existing CSS variables
No JavaScript yet — you can test by manually adding class="dark-mode" to <body> in your browser dev tools
Test: page looks correct in dark mode when class is manually toggled

Step 3 — Wire up the toggle button (JavaScript)
- Small <script> block: clicking the button adds/removes .dark-mode on <body>
Test: clicking the button switches the page live (resets on reload)

Step 4 — Persist preference with localStorage
- On load: check localStorage and apply dark mode if it was saved
On toggle: save or clear the preference
Test: reload the page → your preference sticks

Step 5 — Copy the script to all 4 pages
- The same script block goes into about.html, services.html, and appointment.html
Test: navigate between pages → dark mode stays on

Step 6 — Smooth transition effect
- Add a CSS transition on body so the color swap animates instead of snapping
Also swap the button icon (☀️ ↔ 🌙) to reflect the current mode
Test: toggle feels polished and icon updates correctly

Step 7 — Final visual review
- Scan each page for any hardcoded colors that bypass the CSS variables
Fix any contrast or visibility issues found
